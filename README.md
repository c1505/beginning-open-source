# BeginningOpenSource

A tool to find beginner friendly open source issues to work on.

**NOTE:** Unless you provide a github token to authenicate, your search results will only return repository descriptions and stars once per hour due to github api restrictions".  Please only generate a public token as this application only accesses public data.  Instructions to generate a github token are here: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/ .
